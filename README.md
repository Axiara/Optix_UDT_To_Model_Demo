# Optix_UDT_To_Model_Demo
Demo using a PLC UDT as a Model For a Datagrid / Listbox / Combo Box in FT Optix

  -The Model property of Data Grids, List Boxes, and Comboboxes do not directly support a UDT array from the PLC.
  
  -The lightweight Netlogic script in this example converts the UDT array into a object model that can be used in Optix.
  
  -The Model generated directly references the PLC tag array with node pointers, they don't just copy the values. So updates to variables are fast and bidirectional.


**To Use**

  -Add the UDT Model Builder to the Data Grid

  -PLC tag for the UDT Array is linked to the TagArray Variable of the Netlogic Object

  -Then, the Model of the DataGrid is linked to the GridModel variable of the Netlogic object

  -Attached is the sample Optix program with a sample PLC program that pairs with the demo. Configure the comms driver in Optix and go online with the plc to see it in action!
